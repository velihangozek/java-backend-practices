# FirstReverse

A simple yet efficient Java algorithm solution that reverses a given string. This project demonstrates the "First Reverse" problem using Java's `StringBuilder` for an elegant one-line solution.

## Overview

The **FirstReverse** project is designed to take a string as input and return the reversed version of that string. This approach leverages Java's built-in methods to ensure both clarity and performance, making it ideal for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Features

- **Concise Implementation:** Minimal and easy-to-read code.
- **Efficient Reversal:** Utilizes `StringBuilder.reverse()` for optimal performance.
- **Educational:** Great for learning about basic string manipulation in Java.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or above

### Code Explanation & Usage

- Contains the **FirstReverse** method which reverses the input string using **StringBuilder**.

- The main method reads the user input and prints the reversed string.

- Run the `Main.java` file and when prompted, type a string (e.g., **"Hello World and Coders"**). :

`Input Example:`


    ```bash
    Hello World and Coders
    ```

`Output:`

    ```bash
    sredoC dna dlroW olleH
    ```
