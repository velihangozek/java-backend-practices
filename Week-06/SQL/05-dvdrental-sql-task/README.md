## üìã Queries Overview

### 1. Top 5 longest films ending with **'n'**

```sql
SELECT title, length
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%n'
ORDER BY length DESC, title ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2. Films ranked 6‚Äì10 by ascending length (titles ending with **'n'**)

**Option A: `OFFSET` / `LIMIT`**

```sql
SELECT title, length
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%n'
ORDER BY length ASC, title ASC
OFFSET 5
LIMIT 5;
```

**Option B: CTE + Window Function**

```sql
WITH ranked_films AS (
  SELECT
    title,
    length,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY length ASC, title ASC) AS rn
  FROM film
  WHERE title LIKE '%n'
)
SELECT title, length
FROM ranked_films
WHERE rn BETWEEN 6 AND 10
ORDER BY rn;
```

### 3. First 4 customers (store\_id = 1) ordered by **last\_name** descending

```sql
SELECT last_name, store_id
FROM customer
WHERE store_id = 1
ORDER BY last_name DESC
LIMIT 4;
```

## üìñ Notes

* Redundant `ORDER BY` clauses have been removed for clarity.
* Window functions provide a more explicit ranking approach for Query 2.
